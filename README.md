# PRISM

Prism is a pure zig terminal manipulation library for Linux to build TUI programs.

## Quick Start

Enter the alternate screen, enable the raw module, turn on mouse tracking,
take a look at the `examples/event.zig`.

You may also want to run this example, which is pretty simple:

```bash
zig build examples
zig-out/bin/event
```
